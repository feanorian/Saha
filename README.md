# Saha
The Saha equation, for a gas in thermal equilibriumm,  relates ionization states to the temperature anre pressure of the gas. 
In particular, we can find the ratio of particles in differing ionazation states.


To use this script: 


**Saha()**: Calculates the relative densities. For this HW problem, this is done for 5000 K, 15000 K, and 25000 K.


**pdense()**:  Plots the relative densities as a function of temperature. 


**Saha2()**: Effectictively the same thing as Saha, but is calculating the fraction of ionized hydrogen. Enter the partition function **Z**, 
temperature **T** in Kelvin, and energy **E** in electronvolts.
